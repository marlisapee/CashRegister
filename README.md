# Cash Register Project

## What Are We Trying to Make?

GOAL: Design and build a cash register that can:

- Add and remove items
- Counts the amount of coins and bills in the drawer
- Sum the total amount of money in the drawer
- Determine whether it is possible to create a specific cash amount from the current items in the drawer
- Computes the change required from a transaction and removes it from the drawer if possible.
